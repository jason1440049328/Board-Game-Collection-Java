# Team JuJaJeLo

### As a project team, we promise to:
 * respect each other's ideas and work.
 * communicate with the team regularly to keep everyone in the loop about the project.
 * if you talk about completing something by the deadline, make sure to get it done before then
 * don't leave things for the last minute to do and then cause conflicts

### If someone on our team breaks one or more of these promises, the team may:
 * have a team meeting and ask the person to follow this agreement.
 * report the issue in the Team Sprint Report.
 * once or twice is fine, but continually breaking promises may be a problem that everyone should meet and discuss
 * document it in Readme with things that were intended to be done but wasn't
 

### Team Procedures:
 * Tuesday to plan out the week's goals, and then intermittent meetings on Thursday/Friday to talk about progress,
 meeting on Weekend to make sure things can be done in time
 * Groupme and Zoom to talk about problems that arise, discuss new code
 * By majority vote, consensus
 * Everyone can have a few items to discuss and then throughout it make sure everyone gets a chance to talk
 and discuss what they want to clarify. Reference goals from the start of the week to make sure they are accomplished.
